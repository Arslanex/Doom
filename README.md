# PROJECT: DOOM ðŸ˜ˆ
There is no need to talk much about it, the classic DOOM game, the ancestor of the FPS genre, 
is re-made with Python programming language and PyGame library. It was a project that was fun 
to make and even more fun to try. I think it is a very nice project idea for object oriented 
programming with Python.

I made this project by following the tutorials on the [Coder Space youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CoderSpaceChannel).
